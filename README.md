What is Terraform?
Terraform allows us to define and manage infrastructure configurations as code.
This means we can describe our desired infrastructure in a declarative manner using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL),
and Terraform takes care of provisioning and managing the infrastructure accordingly.

Today's Focus
Today, we'll start by setting up foundational AWS infrastructure using Terraform. 
This includes creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and multiple subnets within it.
These resources are essential building blocks for any cloud-based application or service deployment.
